                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>1. “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>2. “For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today
                    were
                    the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer
                    has
                    been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>3. “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied
                    is to
                    do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you
                    haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know
                    when
                    you find it.”</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>4. “I’ve always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don’t know why. Because
                    they’re
                    harder. They’re much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where
                    everybody
                    tells you that you’ve completely failed.”</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>5. “Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking
                    you have
                    something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”</span></li>
            <li><span>6. “Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The
                    heaviness of
                    being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter one
                    of
                    the most creative periods of my life.”</span></li>
            <li><span>7. “It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what
                    they
                    want until you show it to them.”</span></li>
            <li><span>8. “I’m as proud of many of the things we haven’t done as the things we have done. Innovation is
                    saying
                    no to a thousand things.”</span></li>
            <li><span>9. “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied
                    is to
                    do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you
                    haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know
                    when
                    you find it.”</span></li>
            <li><span>10. “Quality is more important than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles.”</span></li>
            <li><span>11. “Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is
                    expected.”</span></li>
            <li><span>12. “My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept each others’ negative
                    tendencies in check; they balanced each other. And the total was greater than the sum of the
                    parts.”</span></li>
            <li><span>13. “Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly and get on
                    with
                    improving your other innovations.”</span></li>
            <li><span>14. “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So
                    you
                    have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in
                    something—your
                    gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the
                    difference in my life.”</span></li>
            <li><span>15. “That’s been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex; you
                    have to
                    work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.”</span></li>
            <li><span>16. “Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying
                    we’ve
                    done something wonderful...that’s what matters to me.”</span></li>
            <li><span>17. “I'm convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the
                    non-successful
                    ones is pure perseverance.”</span></li>
            <li><span>18. “Technology is nothing. What’s important is that you have a faith in people, that they’re
                    basically
                    good and smart, and if you give them tools, they’ll do wonderful things with them.”</span></li>
            <li><span>19. “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.”</span></li>
            <li><span>20. “My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious
                    resource
                    we all have is time.”</span></li>
            <li><span>21. “Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow know what you truly want
                    to
                    become.”</span></li>
            <li><span>22. “Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith.”</span></li>
            <li><span>23. “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by
                    dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’
                    opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart
                    and
                    intuition.”</span></li>
            <li><span>24. “We don’t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent.
                    Because
                    this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? And we’ve all chosen to do this with
                    our
                    lives. So, it better be damn good. It better be worth it.”</span></li>
            <li><span>25. “I want to put a ding in the universe.”</span></li>
