            What kind of person do I want to be
            Samari Tan
            3rd draft</p>

        <p>There are no two same flowers in this world, just like that there are no two identical people.
            You and I, are not different from this flower. Each of us has a different charm and emits a special
            fragrance.
            But life is very cruel, it has thousands of ways, one petal, and one petal, to take off what you are proud
            of,
            and break you down. When you are broken, it’s very hard to feel special.</p>
        <p> I could remember when I was in junior high school, in a Math class. Our teacher set a very difficult
            geometric
            problem on the blackboard. No one could solve it. Only me solved the problem with the help of a support
            line. I
            still clearly remembered the smile on my Math teacher’s face, and she kept saying: "very smart, very smart,
            very smart!" in front of the whole class. So everyone consider me the smartest student. But I have no clue
            that
            this support line would take me to another direction of life.</p>

        <p> When I graduated from High school, I noticed that smartness can't help me get into Tsinghua. And my family
            don’t have a Wanda. I am not special. Just at that time, I live in a QQ and WeChat world, which means I’m
            really good at showing people that life is amazing even though I’m depressed. So more or less, I used to
            find
            belonging in the virtual world.</p>

        <p>
            But the real world is always there. In the third year of my college, when my parents continue to remind me
            "the
            son of the other family", cause they want to use pressure to push me forward. However, no one thought that
            the
            mental health of adult is as fragile as a baby. My mental health was broken, I got a very serious mental
            problem. It’s called paranoia, which caused by anxiety and delusion. You know when people watch horror
            movies,
            what do we do when we are afraid of looking at the horrible scene? Close your eyes. However, for me, I
            cannot
            close my eyes, because those horror movies are played in my mind. Not only myself, but also the person I
            care
            about, could involve in that movies. Vividly. I was suffering from this pain over and over again.
        </p>

        <p>Fortunately, I met someone. Her name is Jessica. Actually even now we haven't met each other, but she is a
            special. As I mentioned, one of the component of Paranoia is anxiety. When I am extremely anxious about
            life,
            Jessica always used her mature perspective to explain the truth behind it and told me what to do. If life
            is an
            examination, when I encounter the problem of the real world, she is the answer book at my hand.</p>



        <p>With her help, I finally realized that what really makes me special is not smart, but
            I can admit my mistake because I am modest,
            I can make a right choice because I have courage,
            I can beat this paranoia because I am brave,
            I am special because in my heart,I really want to be a better man.</p>


        <p> It can be said that the way I live like this right now largely depends on her.</p>

        <p> The paranoia made me say goodbye to a young kid, let me experience the unique meaning of life.
            And Jessica made me say hello to a better man, making me confident and brave.
            If I am alone, I cannot do this.
            Now, in my spare time, I study psychology. I keep reading books and try to understand the world.
            Because I wish someday in the future, I can reach my hand to the trash bin, let the broken people feel
            special
            again.</p>

        <p>My name is Samari, Thank you.</p>
